# fplid
Disables / Enables fingerprint when lid is closed/open


#meh!

Linux is not disablig fingerprint priority when laptop is closed.
specially annoying when I want to work exclusively from an external monitor.
Would have to wait until the check times out and then type my password.

I saw a few solutions where the lid status in acpi is checked and then the fingerscaer is disable from the usb side.
I want to investigate if I can do it from the pam side.
